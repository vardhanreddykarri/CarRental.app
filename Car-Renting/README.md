# Car-Renting
My final project on python course. In this project I used tkinter library and sqlite to connect the database to the server.

I used tkinter for the UI design and sqlite to store the information about users in database.

In "City, Adress, Full name and Phone number" sections simply input your information, and then choose pick-up and drop-off date and time. Choose the purpose of the rent and which car you want to rent. The program will automatically calculate the cost of the rent and then your information will be written in the database.
